# Electronics Simulator

An electronics simulator made using Reactjs.

How to use:
- Click a component from the component bar on the left.
- The components searchbar will return components whose names start with the input (not case-sensitive).
- Click a blank space on the paper to add that component to the paper.
- Click on the junctions on either side of a component to begin creating a connection. Move the mouse and click on another junction to create a connection. The same connection cannot be made twice. A junction cannot be connected to itself.
- To delete a connection, click on one of the junctions, then the other junction.
- Click the New button on the toolbar above to clear the paper.
